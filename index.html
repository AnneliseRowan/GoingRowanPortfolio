        <h2>bonjour:</h2>
        <p>Being born in a remote village in Africa has given me a drive to never give up. 
            I am results-oriented and my unique ability to combine abstract and logical 
            thinking gives me an edge in the tech world, as does completing 
            The Coding Bootcamp at UNC- Chapel Hill.  My passion is for finding out what works 
            for the individual, whether that be project related or people-oriented. I am fully 
            dedicated to growth for myself and for the company as “Working together is success.” 
            – Henry Ford</p>
